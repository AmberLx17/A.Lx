## BIO
Han mitakuyapi, cante waste nape ciyuzape. Amber Laundreaux emaciyapi ksto. Wanbli Paha na Wakpa Waste el wati ksto.

Hello my relatives, I shake your hand with a good heart. My name is Amber Laundreaux. I am from Eagle Butte and Good River.

I am currently employed with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Youth Diabetes Prevention Program since 2017.  We fight every day to prevent our youth from getting diabetes by giving them information on ways to prevent diabetes, we plan activities with our schools or communities, we hold lunch and learns with classrooms, we host our yearly school screenings. We are located in Eagle Butte, SD  and cover most of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Schools such as Takini, Dupree, Laplant, Windswept Academy and Cheyenne Eagle Butte schools.

I plan on graduating from Oglala Lakota College in 2025 with my B.S in Information Technology.  My future plans are to stay within my tribe and put my knowledge and skills to work as an IT Tech.  With hopes of also teaching strength, resiliency, foster positive identity development and help uphold tribal sovereignty.  Information Technology can be a powerful source for many tribes by providing valuable education for their tribal members.  By using social media and online sources tribes can reach out to different generations, especially those which are tech-savvy and enjoy communicating via the internet.  

I come from a big family, 5 brothers and 5 sisters.  My one and only child was born on my 21st birthday, she is now 17 years old!
